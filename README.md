> Hydrologic Unit (HUC) - The United States Geological Survey has developed a system that assigns drainage areas throughout the nation to a particular region, subregion, accounting unit and cataloging unit.  Cataloging units, or 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) as they are commonly called, delineate small to medium sized drainage areas.  
The Chesapeake Bay watershed is located entirely within region 02 (Mid-Atlantic Region - the drainage within the United States that ultimately discharges into: (a) the Atlantic Ocean within and between the states of New York and Virginia; (b) Long Island Sound south of the New York-Connecticut State Line; and (c) the Riviere Richelieu, a tributary of the St. Lawrence River.  Includes all of Delaware and New Jersey and the District of Columbia, and parts of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia).
Within the Mid-Atlantic Region, there are four subregions that are at least partially comprised of drainage areas within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  They are:
>> 0205 - the Susquehanna River basin in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania (27,200 square miles)  
>> 0206 - the Upper Chesapeake Bay and its tributary drainage north of the Maryland-Virginia state line including the Pocomoke River drainage, excluding the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins; and the coastal drainage from the Delaware Bay drainage boundary to Chincoteague Inlet on the Delmarva Peninsula.  Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania (8,980 square miles)  
>> 0207 - the Potomac River Basin in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia (14,600 square miles)  
>> 0208 - the Lower Chesapeake Bay and its tributary drainage south of the Maryland-Virginia state line excluding the Pocomoke River drainage; and the coastal drainage from Chincoteague Inlet on the Delmarva Peninsula to the Back Bay drainage boundary (18,500 square miles)  
> Within these four subregions, there are fifty six 8-digit hydrologic units that comprise the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed (Chincoteague and Eastern Lower Delmarva are outside the watershed).  These are used as the basis for searching Chesapeake bay Program databases. 
   
> ####County/City (FIPS) - the Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) assigns 5-digit codes to all counties and incorporated cities in the United States.  The first two digits correspond to the state and the last three to the county or incorporated city within that state.  
> ####Monitoring Segment - In 1998, the Chesapeake Bay Program redefined its monitoring segmentation scheme to be based upon salinity regime.  The following suffixes are associated with areas based upon salinity levels in parts per thousand (ppt):  
>>> TF (tidal fresh) - 0.0 to 0.5 ppt   
>>> OH (oligohaline) - 0.5 to 5.0 ppt   
>>> MH (mesohaline) - 5.0 to 18.0 ppt   
>>> PH (polyhaline) - 18.0 to 35.0 ppt  
> #####Monitoring Station - refers to the text identifier used to denote a monitoring station.  
> #####Water Body - refers to the body of water in which the monitoring station is located.
